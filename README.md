# Simple React Typescript Component Library

This is a simple React component library built with Typescript.

## To see changes BEFORE publishing to NPM

1. In the `ck-button` directory, run `npm link`
2. In the `next-demo` directory, run `npm link @chris-cross-crash/ck-button`

Note that if you publish a new package, it must be published before linking.

Thanks to Jonathan Chiam for writing [the article](https://medium.com/@jchiam/publishing-a-typescript-react-component-to-npm-d3cc15b8d0a2) that helped me get this working.
